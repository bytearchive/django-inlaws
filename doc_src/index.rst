Django Inlaws v |version|
=========================

When you are editing an object, Django Inlaws shows a sidebar containing objects related to it in the database. It consists of a replacement template for the Admin's change form and some template tags.

The objects shown in the sidebar are those which:

#. have a registered Admin interface
#. are not explicitly excluded.
